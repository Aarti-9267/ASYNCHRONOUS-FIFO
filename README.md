# ASYNCHRONOUS-FIFO
Design and verification of Dual Clock Asynchronous FIFO using Verilog and custom testbench

Designed an asynchronous First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer in verilog to enable data transfer between two independent clock domains. Implemented gray-code pointer synchronization and metastability mitigation techniques to ensure reliable cross-domain communication. Verified functionality through behavioral simulation using ModelSim, demonstrating a strong understanding of clock domain crossing (CDC), digital memory design, and RTL-level coding.
